# Installing the Telerik Controls from a NuGet Package



This article explains how to use the NuGet feed and packages provided by Telerik to get the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX controls in your project.

This feed is available as of Q3 2015 SP1 (ver. 2015.3.1111).


>caution  **Prerequisite** 
>In order to have the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX running, you will need to have [ASP.NET AJAX](http://www.asp.net/AJAX/Documentation/Live/InstallingASPNETAJAX.aspx) installed on your development/production machine.

1. Open Visual Studio.

1. Go to **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Settings**, select **Package Manager Sources** and then click the **+** button to add a feed.

1. Add a feed with the following URL: **https://nuget.telerik.com/nuget** and click **OK**.

1. Choose the **Online** / **Browse** list of packages (depending on your VS version).

1. Enter your Telerik credentials in the Windows Authentication dialog (e.g., user: *my.name@my.company.com* and password: *myPassPhraseForTelerikDotCom*).

## Downloading a NuGet Package

You can download a *.nupkg* file to [build a private feed](http://www.telerik.com/blogs/power-your-projects-with-telerik---now-with-the-convenience-of-nuget) for your company by following the steps below.

>important Such a feed must be private (i.e., not available to the general Internet) and the standard developer-seat [licensing model]({%slug introduction/licensing/license-agreement%}) applies (i.e., the developers working with the controls must have active licenses). If you have questions on the licensing scheme, send them to telerik-sales@progress.com.


1. Navigate to [Your Account](https://www.telerik.com/account/).

1. Go to the [Downloads page of UI for ASP.NET AJAX](https://www.telerik.com/account/product-download?product=RCAJAX).

1. Click on the *.nupkg* files you require (e.g., *Telerik.UI.for.AspNet.Ajax.Net45.2016.3.1027.nupkg*) to download them. The file name is built in the following format: `Telerik.UI.for.AspNet.Ajax.Net<.NET version of your project>.<Telerik controls version>.nupkg`.

1. Configure your server and projects to use the feed.

 
## Automated Builds

If you are using the Telerik NuGet feed on an automated build environment, you can provide your own credentials to the build PC so that it can connect to the feed and download the package.


You can read more about adding credentials via the NuGet.config in the following page: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/schema/nuget-config-file#packagesourcecredentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/schema/nuget-config-file#packagesourcecredentials).

You must protect your credentials and ensure they are used only by you and not by other developers, according to the [license-per-developer policy](http://www.telerik.com/purchase/license-agreement/aspnet-ajax). For example, take your encrypted password from your local NuGet.config file and use it on the build PC.
